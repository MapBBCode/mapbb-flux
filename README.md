# MapBBCode Extension for FluxBB

Adds [map] bbcode to a board. Tested with FluxBB 1.4.8 and 1.5.5. To install, unpack `mapbbcode_fluxbb.zip` and follow (very simple) instructions in `readme.txt`.

The plugin is "lazy", that is, built with [MapBBCode Loader](https://github.com/MapBBCode/mapbbcode-loader). To add proprietary layers and configure MapBBCode options, modify `mapBBCodeLoaderOptions` object in `header.php` (after `language` option). See the loader's README for instructions.
